Dataset for Azure End to End project with Adventure Work
Create Dynamic Pipelines with parameters and Loops by pulling data from API source and land it in the bronze layer in data lake. The Bronze layer creates an exact replica of source data in data lake. 
Databricks - It is the hulk of data engineering because of its powerful spark clusters which are very useful when working with big data (picks data from bronze layer & push it to the silver layer with some transformations using spark). 
Azure Synapse Analytics - serving layer - after applying some transformations and cleaning the data its time to server our data to our stakeholders (Data analyst or data scientist).
Reporting - learn how to establish connections between synapse and power BI, how to build link services and how to pull tables and data warehouse fact and dimension tables.
